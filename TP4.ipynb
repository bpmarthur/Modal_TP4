    "**Exercise 2.** Supposing that all entities are written such that they start with a capital letter, perform entity recognition in the text file *example-nobel.txt* using regular expression. You should also be able to capture with the regex that an entity can have 2 or more names, such as Barack Obama. For this, first follow this tutorial https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp on the **re library** in Python. When you have an idea for a regex, you can test it using this website https://regex101.com/ . Note the website even generates the corresponding Python code for you! You might need to read a bit about repeating a group https://www.regular-expressions.info/captureall.html ."
